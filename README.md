# R Shiny pacificMusic

This is a music app where we have gathered four different gadgets to help users explore musics they like.

This was created as group work for Duke University STA 523 2019 Fall, Final Project. 

Refer to [here](https://christineshen421.shinyapps.io/pacificMusic) for the deployment of the Shiny app.
